The "LawBridge" protocol that Eclipse uses to communicate with its own
Bridge program is as follows:

Text is sent in ASCII format.

Commands are sent as follows: 0x02 (command) 0x03 (it can also be
represented as ^B (command) ^C)

Some of the commands can contain extra data, and that data may contain
the 0x02 and 0x03 values, so you definitely cannot look for 0x02 and
then look for the next 0x03 to see when the command is complete. It will
be necessary to look at the command letter to see how many characters of
data are expected after that.

Here is a list of the commands:

P -- Page number. Followed by two bytes of data, which is a word
containing the current page number (little-endian.)
Example: 0x02 P 0x1D 0x02 0x03 (represents page number 0x021D, or 541)

N -- Line number. Followed by one byte of data containing the line number
Example: 0x02 N 0x12 0x03 (line number 0x12, or 18)

F -- Format. Followed by one byte indicating the paragraph format. The
formats are as follows:
0x00: Fixed line
0x01: Question
0x02: Answer
0x03: Speaker
0x04: Question continuation
0x05: Answer continuation
0x06: Speaker continuation
0x07: Parenthetical
0x08: Centered
0x09: Right-flush
0x0A: By line
0x0B: By line continuation
0x0C+: User-defined
Example: 0x02 F 0x03 0x03 (indicates that the following text is part of
a speaker paragraph)
This is one of those items that you can ignore, but it might be valuable
to have some of this information. Most litigation support software has
to guess what's a question or answer by searching for things like " Q. "
in the text, which is an inexact science, at best. Using this data would
allow you to have functions such as the ability jump back to the
previous question, or to search for a speaker named "MR. JONES", etc.

T -- Timecode. This is critical information and should be recorded. It's
followed by four bytes of information for Hours, Minutes, Seconds and
Frames (30ths of a second)
Example: 0x02 T 0x11 0x05 0x0C 0x02 0x03 (17 hours, 5 minutes, 12
seconds, 2 frames, [5:05 p.m.])

D -- Delete (backspace). This removes the previous character from the data
Example: 0x02 D 0x03

K -- Prevent saving. This tells the client program that the attorney
does not have permission to save the file
Example: 0x02 K 0x03


E -- End refresh (see below)

R -- Refresh. Followed by 8 bytes: A starting timecode and an ending
timecode. The timecode format is identical to the T command.
The refresh command will be followed by a stream of text and commands
which is in exactly the same format as the text would originally have
been transmitted in. It will contain page/line commands, format
commants, timecodes, etc. This text is intended to replace everything
between the starting and ending timecodes.

So when you get a refresh command, you have two choices concerning how
to process it:

1. Buffer all of the following text until the E command is received. At
that point, delete everything between the timecodes and replace it with
the buffered text. Then go back to receiving realtime data normally.

2. Erase everything between the timecodes immediately. Insert the new
text in realtime as it is transmitted (in the spot where the original
text was deleted.) When the E command is received, go back to inserting
realtime text at the bottom of the file.
